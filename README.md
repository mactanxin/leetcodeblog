## Install MariaDB / MySQLdb and Memcached
MariaDB is shipped in the CentOS repo as of CentOS 7 instead of mysql.
if you still want to install mysql you need to add mysql rpm dependency into your yum repo.

```shell
sudo yum install python-devel
sudo yum install mysql-devel
sudo yum install gcc
sudo yum -y install memcached
systemctl restart memcached
systemctl start memcached
```
Be sure that Memcached starts at boot:
```shell
systemctl enable memcached
```

To check the status of Memcached:
```shell
systemctl status memcached
```

To stop memcached
```shell
systemctl stop memcached
```

## After everything is done

python manage.py syncdb --noinput
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
